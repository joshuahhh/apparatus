        <h2>Prototypes in Javascript</h2>

        <p>As most folk know, objects in Javascript have these mysterious things
        called "prototypes". Apparatus's node system starts with prototypal
        inheritance. So before we get to Apparatus's system, let's reinvent
        Javascript's prototypes.</p>

        <p>On the right is a Javascript object <JsObj>TodoList</JsObj>. It
        represents a todo list UI element in some hip new todo webapp.</p>

        <Breakpoint name='props' />

        <p>Our object represents a bundle of data and behaviors. These are
        attached using properties. Here are some properties of <JsObj>TodoList</JsObj>:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <b><code><JsObj>TodoList</JsObj>.render</code> = <Hoverify hoverCode='TodoList_render'><code>function() {'{...}'}</code></Hoverify></b>
            <p>This is a function which renders the list to the screen. The
            function's code can refer to <code>this.todos</code>. When
            <code><JsObj>TodoList</JsObj>.render()</code> is called,
            <code>this</code> will be bound to <JsObj>TodoList</JsObj>, so the
            correct data will be accessed.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b><code><JsObj>TodoList</JsObj>.todos</code> = <Hoverify hoverCode='TodoList_todos'><code>["Run", "Play"]</code></Hoverify></b>
            <p>This is the data backing the UI element: a simple list of todo
            tasks as strings.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <Breakpoint name='object2' />

        <p>Later in the development of the hip webapp, we decide that there
        should be two todo lists on the screen. We add a second object, {' '}
        <JsObj>TodoList2</JsObj>. It's practically the same as {' '}
        <JsObj>TodoList</JsObj>. In particular, it shares the exact same
        <code>.render</code> function. The only difference is that <JsObj>TodoList2</JsObj>
        has different data stored in <code>.todos</code>, so when <code><JsObj>TodoList2</JsObj>.render()</code>
      is called, a different set of todos will be rendered.</p>

        <p>(Now is a good time to make clear that, so far, there are no
        prototypes or classes or anything like that in the picture. All we have
        are simple objects, representing bundles of properties.)</p>

        <p>But this is clearly a messy situation. <JsObj>TodoList</JsObj> and
        {' '}<JsObj>TodoList2</JsObj> have different data (<code>.todos</code>), but
        they share the same behavior (<code>.render</code>). What we would like
        is some way to take the shared behavior and store it in just one place.</p>

        <Breakpoint name="proto" />

        <p>That is exactly what prototypes let us do. Here
        we introduce a new object called <JsObj>TodoListProto</JsObj>. It will
        serve as the "prototype" for TODO</p>
