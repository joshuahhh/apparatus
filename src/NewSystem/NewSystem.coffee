# NOTES:

# 1. For now, we are eliminating the idea of running a change in a tree in any
# but the root context. You should build up trees for cloned symbols first, and
# then clone them into the tree whole.

# 2. Don't ever have links directly between nodes, while you're still running
# changes on the tree. Why? It makes cloning really hard! Just use IDs, and then
# you'll be fine.

# 2.1. What happens when you clone a tree with mixed-in properties? OH WOW maybe
# we can just use prototypes here? We'll have to be perpetually careful about,
# e.g., "do you really have a parent listed yet?" The alternative is just to
# copy over properties. (That would be easiest if we had mixed-in properties
# stored in a special property object.)

# A "Change" is a description of a change which can be performed to a tree.
# Changes are a static, syntactic sort of thing, except for the "apply" method.

# DESIGN NOTE: The more high-level Changes are, the more robust they can be. For
# instance, take the process of moving a node to a new parent. For simplicity,
# you might want to encode this as two Changes: 1. Remove from parent X. 2. Add
# to parent Y. However, if "the past changes" (because some cloned symbol
# changes) and the node no longer has X as a parent, things will break! It is
# better to have a single change which performs both the removal from the
# (unknown) previous parent and the addition to the new tree. This means that
# changes will have to do more "looking around" in the tree.

# DESIGN QUESTION: Should deleting a node remove it and all of its children from
# the tree, or just de-parent it? What happens if, post-cloning, some descendent
# node is moved outside the deleted node?

#
# A case study on CLONING and CONSTRUCTORS:
#
# Apparatus nodes sometimes need complex bits of mutable state which require
# per-node set-up. For instance, Attributes have a @value Dataflow cell which
# needs to be hooked up to the right value function, bound to the right `this`.
# (NOTE: Some of this state could maybe be re-engineered? But let's put that
# aside for now.) This means that for every Attribute which is added to a
# diagram, directly or indirectly (through nth-order cloning), we need to run
# some set-up code.
#
# At first I thought I had a good solution to this: add a "RunMethod" change to
# the Attribute symbol's changelist. But with the current cloning system
# (construct-then-copy), this doesn't work: the constructed mutable state
# refers to the ORIGINAL nodes, and when you clone them, it is misdirected.
#
# If we used the construct-in-place cloning system, this wouldn't be a problem,
# since the "RunMethod" change would be running on what would ultimately be the
# final node in the diagram.
#
# But I am wary of adopting construct-in-place, since it means we can't keep
# around pre-built trees to clone as needed... it shuts off a LOT of
# opportunities for memoization. (Implementation is also a liiittle bit tricky,
# since you need to keep the context of what "place" you're cloning into around
# for everything you do, rather than just ignoring it, and having a single
# centralized copy method.)
#
# How can we implement constructor (or constructor-like) behavior in a
# construct-then-copy world? One option is just to do what Apparatus does now:
# have constructors, and run them on copy. I am wary of this for exactly one
# reason: how do you stack up constructors? Does each constructor have to refer
# to previous ones explicitly? Can we just assume they run in order, and
# maintain a constructor queue? (I really don't want to rely on JS inheritance
# bullshit, or have nodes referring to their "masters". NO SLAVES, NO MASTERS.)
# Or maybe we can keep the existing API, with "RunMethod", but keep a "methods
# to run on copy" queue? That sounds real slick. I think I'll do that for now.
# (But I think I'll switch to calling them "constructors", since that makes
# their semantics more clear?)

# 2016-07-18
#
# On what changes can be:
#
# So I coded up a bunch of "changesForX" methods, which take a living node and
# generate a list of changes which achieve a given effect. I used them in tests
# and everything looked great.
#
# I was implementing Element::changesForAddVariable, and it seemed clear that it
# should call Attribute::changesForSetExpression. I realized I was in trouble:
# changesForX methods live on live nodes, but they're supposed to construct
# static representations of potential future changes. How can I call
# changesForSetExpression on attributes which I am only imagining and never
# actually creating?
#
# I saw two roads forward:
#
# 1. Change the interface that changesForX methods work with, so that they
# actually perform the changes as they go, and can refer to intermediate
# products when deriving future changes in the list.
#
# 2. Design the set of changes so that you never need access to live nodes to
# construct compound change-lists. Better way to put this: design the set of
# changes so that all "changesForX" methods can be static methods. (That way,
# Element::changesForAddVariable can call Attribute::changesForSetExpression.)
#
# Thinking about it, I realized that "never need[ing] access to live nodes to
# construct compound change-lists" was actually a requirement for another
# important reason: robustness of changes to modifications of earlier cloned
# symbols. Attribute::changesForSetExpression is a very good example here. In
# its current implementation, it looks at existing references and pushes changes
# to remove them. Those individual changes then become the permanent source of
# truth on the symbol's change-list. But what if you're setting an expression
# which comes from a cloned symbol, and the symbol's expression changes to have
# different references? The individual reference-removals you hard-coded on the
# change-list are no longer valid, and your diagram will be corrupted.
#
# So there's actually an elegant convenience here: by writing your changesForX
# methods statically, you ensure they don't rely on any tree state (other than
# the explicitly provided arguments), which is likely to make change-lists more
# robust. I like this a lot.
#
# To be clear, this requires that more types of changes be implemented. You
# can't just depend on some RISC. But I like this, because higher-level changes
# do a better job of expressing programmer intent, and can do a better job of
# accurately performing this intent in a shifting environment.

# 2016-07-19
#
# On IDs:
#
# change_X functions shouldn't call Util.generateId(), since this introduces
# non-determinism, and these functions are used to set up the built-in
# environment. Util.generateId() should only really be called by the UI, in
# response to user interactions.


# 2016-07-25
#
# Recent thoughts:
#
# 1. createVariantOfBuiltinSymbol should probably make shortcuts for ALL
# pointers on the master, not just "root". So when you define Shape, you make a
# pointer "transform" to the TransformComponent, and then that pointer persists
# even as you define different nth-order clones of Shape. This way, you don't
# need to count out "master"s when you want to refer to some Shape's transform.
# Not sure how this fits with the desire to have createVariantOfBuiltinSymbol be
# "static" (not depend on rendered trees) â€“ how do we know what pointers exist
# and should be cloned? One way to keep it static: explicitly list which
# pointers should be rewritten. Another way to keep it static: make rewriting
# pointers part of a Change. For instance, there could be an argument to
# Change_CloneSymbol called "copyPointers".
#
# 2. I am troubled by the fragility of node IDs, as determined by the cloning
# hierarchy. For instance, if I want to change how Attributes work, by adding a
# new "superclass", then this will change the node-IDs of all attributes. My
# hope, that existing user-change-lists would be compatible with the new
# BuiltinEnvironment, would fail, if the user changes refer to attributes using
# their whole node ID.
#
# 3. OH WAIT the above two issues (really one issue) can be resolved if we have
# a concept of a "primary" cloning operation (of a symbol which could be called
# a "master"), which, rather than just preserving pointers, actually preserves
# node IDs. When you perform a primary-clone, you don't prepend a clone-id to
# the node IDs; you keep them as they are. I think this makes a lot of sense. My
# one concern is, what happens to our ability to apply new changes in the
# definitions of cloned symbols "in place"? (This isn't something we support
# now, and it might never be, but I was happy that I was keeping the door open
# to this feature, or ones like it.) Well, let's think this out: If we wanted to
# have a feature like this, we'd need to keep track of what clones exist in our
# tree (no matter what). So we have some list of cloning-ids, together with
# their origins and relevant metadata. This list would necessarily NOT be
# affected by the node-id compression: it would use paths with "master". (We
# need to distinguish from "master" and "master/master" clonings!) So then, if
# we wanted to apply a change to, say, the "master/master/transform/master"
# cloning, we would take the local node ids in the change and prepend
# "transform" to put them in context. I guess the "master"s don't really matter
# here? OK this is confusing but my intuition is that everything still works.
# Let's do this!
